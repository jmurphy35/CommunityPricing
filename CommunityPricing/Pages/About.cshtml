<p><h5>The overall goal of Community Pricing &copy; - (CP) is to provide information to the public.  Here, information refers
    to data collected by casual observation by any of those persons acting to contribute to CP.  Information gained
    in this way may be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading.
    </h5></p>

<p><h5>The first goal of Community Pricing &copy; - (CP) is to provide information, as above, in the form of the names and locations of vendors
    who sell those products upon which CP chooses to report. Providing information about vendors' product offerings may depend
    upon the willingness of those vendors to participate in providing this information.  Therefore, this information may not be complete,
    for example, with respect to all of the vendors who sell a particular product in any given geographical area.  CP hopes that people will benefit
    from an organized list of offerings of vendors who sell a product.
    </h5></p>

<p><h5>CP seeks to provide the price for each product that it lists as well as the date that that price was observed by CP or its contributors.
    CP seeks to provide the public with an ordering of those products by price.</h5></p>

<p><h5>CP seeks to provide other statistics on products sold by vendors that will be interesting and/or helpful to the public.</h5></p>

<p><h5>This website, Community Pricing &copy;, displays information that is already publicized or that is easily discoverable.
    This website organizes and then produces statistics on that information, and displays that to the general public.</h5></p>
