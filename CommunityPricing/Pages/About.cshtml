<p><h5>The first goal of Community Pricing &copy; - (CP) will be to report the names and locations of each and every vendor
    within a chosen geographical area who offer and sell products upon which CP chooses to report. CP will choose
    to report on products that it feels are important or essential to the welfare of a particular community.
    By using this approach CP hopes that the people in that community will benefit from a direct and comprehensive list of vendors
    who sell a product that is important to them.
    </h5></p>
<p><h5>CP seeks provide the price for each product listed and the date that that product was observed by CP or its contributors
    to be sold at that price. Here CP seeks to provide the public with a ranking of prices of a product sold at each vendor
    who sells that product.</h5></p>

<p><h5>CP seeks to provide other statistics on products sold by vendors that will be interesting and/or helpful to the public.</h5></p>

<p><h5>CP seeks to be accurate and complete, but makes no promise of accuracy, completeness, or other virtue when it provides
    information to the public. However, accuracy and completeness are a motivation here because success may depend
    on those virtues.</h5></p>

<p><h5>This website, Community Pricing &copy;, displays information that is already publicized or that is easily discoverable.
    This website organizes and then produces statistics on that information and then displays that to the general public.</h5></p>
